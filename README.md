# SwiftuiAuthBase

## Description

I started this project to improve my understanding of 
firebase and SwiftUI. I'm going to implement first the 
authentication part of the app and then a generic item 
object connected to the user.

Feel free to use this code as you want and comment 
anything in order to improve the design and architacture 
of the app.
